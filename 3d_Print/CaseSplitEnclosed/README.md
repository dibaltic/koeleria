# Features
- Enclosed MCU with 3d files supporting use of displays and no displays
- Snap on top shell/plate, with PCB threaded into lower shell
- Low profile case, with the anti-slip feet installed, the case adds 1.5mm to the height of the PCB
- Recessed anti-slip feet to maintain low profile

# Details
- The M2 hardware linked is a variety of sizes. I used 7 inch diagonal cutters to trim the bolts to the length needed since none of the variety in the pack is an exact fit. If you do not trim the bolts that are too long, it will leave marks on the back of the case.

- Break-off tabs on the PCB will need removed to be flush with the rest of the PCB edge. Remaining pieces from the break-off tabs may make the case not fit correctly.

- To install the brass heatserts, I used my soldering iron to melt the inserts into the case. The case is intended to be as low profile as I could make it, so there are tight tolerances for the depth. Care must be taken to not insert the inserts too far as you will melt through the back. Even if you don't melt through, on lighter colors of filament the insert will be visible as seen in the picture above.

- The 5 pin header for the nice!views should be placed within the outline on the PCB silkscreen. To put the mcu cover on, I suggest putting the opening for the usb-c on first, and then slide the cover down over the nice!view header. I trimmed the pins that are soldered to the nice!views with flush cutters, just the excess that protruded past the solder.
