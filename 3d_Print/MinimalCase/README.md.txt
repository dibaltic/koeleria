# Features
- Thin minimal case with no switch plate or mcu enclosure
- Low profile case, with the anti-slip feet installed, the case adds 1.5mm to the height of the PCB
- Recessed anti-slip feet to maintain low profile
- PCB secured to case with machine screws
- Support for using clear acrylic LCD cover. Requires the use mobo standoffs or spacers with long screws.

> Note: This case adds the same amount of height as the fully enclosed case adds

10x adhesive silicone feet. 8mm x 2.5mm 

# Details
- This is the same case as the fully enclosed version, minus the top shell and less material past the edge of the PCB. The case adds 1mm around the perimeter of the PCB.

- Break-off tabs on the PCB will need removed to be flush with the rest of the PCB edge. Remaining pieces from the break-off tabs may make the case not fit correctly.

- The M2 hardware linked is a variety of sizes. I used 7 inch diagonal cutters to trim the bolts to the length needed since none of the variety in the pack is an exact fit. If you do not trim the bolts that are too long, it will leave marks on the back of the case.

- To install the brass heatserts, I used my soldering iron to melt the inserts into the case. The case is intended to be as low profile as I could make it, so there are tight tolerances for the depth. Care must be taken to not insert the inserts too far as you will melt through the back. Even if you don't melt through, on lighter colors of filament the insert will be visible as seen in the picture above.
